    # 4. Create UMS MCPClient, url is `http://localhost:8006/mcp` (use static method create and don't forget that its async)
    # 5. Collect tools and dict [tool name, mcp client]
    # 6. Do steps 4 and 5 for `https://remote.mcpservers.org/fetch/mcp`
    # 7. Create DialClient, endpoint is `https://ai-proxy.lab.epam.com`
    # 8. Create array with Messages and add there System message with simple instructions for LLM that it should help to handle user request
    # 9. Create simple console chat (as we done in previous tasks)
